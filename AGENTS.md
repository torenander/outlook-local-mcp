# AGENTS.md

* Don't be an overachiever. Focus on the task, aiming for perfection in the execution rather than in adding extras.
* Implement the solution using many small, isolated, single-purpose files. Your primary goal is to minimize the Lines of Code (LoC) in each file. Code duplication is explicitly allowed to maintain this structure.
* Follow the Architectural Governance and Project Requirements Change process.
* Use `deepwiki` MCP for knowledge about specific package implementations details when needed.
* Use the file `.deepwiki` as a repository for relevant DeepWiki repositories.
* Continuously keep the `.gitignore` accurate to not bloat the repository.
* `CHANGELOG.md` is managed by release-please and **MUST NOT** be manually updated.

## Project Structure

**Build:** `go build ./cmd/outlook-local-mcp/`
**Install:** `go install github.com/desek/outlook-local-mcp/cmd/outlook-local-mcp@latest`
**New code** must be placed in the appropriate `internal/` package, not the repository root.

## Documentation Standards

All code **MUST** be extensively documented using Go doc comments:

* **Every package**: Include a package-level docstring in a `doc.go` file or the main package file describing the package's purpose and how it fits into the system.
* **Every function/method**: Include a docstring describing:
    * **Purpose**: What the function does and why it exists.
    * **Parameters**: Meaning of each parameter.
    * **Return value**: What is returned.
    * **Side effects**: Any mutations, API calls, or state changes.
    * **Errors**: Conditions under which an error is returned.
* **Every struct/interface**: Include a docstring describing the type's role and intent.
* **Every exported field**: Document the purpose and intent of each exported field.
* **Complex logic**: Add inline comments to explain non-obvious algorithms or business rules. Reference related ADRs where applicable.

### Docstring Style

* Use standard Go doc comment style (start with the name of the symbol).
* Focus on **intent and purpose** — explain *why*, not just *what*.
* Keep comments concise but complete.
* Update docstrings whenever the implementation changes.

## Design Principles

All code **MUST** adhere to the following design principles consistently:

* **SOLID**:
    * **Single Responsibility**: Each package, struct, or function must have one reason to change.
    * **Open/Closed**: Code must be open for extension but closed for modification.
    * **Liskov Substitution**: Interfaces should be satisfied by types without altering correctness.
    * **Interface Segregation**: Prefer small, focused interfaces over large, general-purpose ones.
    * **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concretions.
* **Composition over Inheritance**: Use embedding and composition to build complex types.
* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract shared logic into reusable abstractions. Note: code duplication for file isolation is acceptable in Go if it avoids unnecessary package dependencies.
* **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Choose the simplest solution. Avoid over-engineering and premature abstraction.
* **Law of Demeter**: A unit should only talk to its immediate collaborators.

## MCPB Extension Manifest

All MCP tools **MUST** be registered in `extension/manifest.json` under the `tools` array. When adding or removing a tool in `internal/server/server.go`, the corresponding entry in the manifest **MUST** be updated to match. The manifest is used by Claude Desktop to discover available tools.

## Tool Naming Convention

As of CR-0060 (v0.6.0) the MCP surface is four aggregate domain tools, each dispatched by a required `operation` verb. New work **MUST** add a verb to the appropriate domain registry, not a new top-level MCP tool.

Aggregate tools and their domains:

* `calendar` -- Calendar and event verbs
* `mail` -- Mail message, folder, and draft verbs
* `account` -- Account management verbs
* `system` -- Server-level verbs (`status`, optional `complete_auth`, `help`, `list_docs`, `search_docs`, `get_docs`); see CR-0061

Verb names **MUST** be self-explanatory English verbs or verb phrases without the domain prefix (for example `create_event`, not `calendar_create_event`). Every domain tool exposes an `operation="help"` verb that documents its registered verbs. The `{domain}.{operation}` identity is what surfaces in audit logs and OpenTelemetry attributes.

The aggregate tool name registered with `mcp.NewTool()` must match the name used in all middleware calls (`wrap`/`wrapWrite`, `WithObservability`, `AuditWrap`) in `server.go`. Per-verb dispatch is handled by `internal/tools/dispatch_route.go`.

## MCP Tool Annotations

All four aggregate MCP tools **MUST** include the full set of five MCP annotations for Anthropic Software Directory compliance (see CR-0052). Per CR-0060, the aggregate annotation **MUST** be the most conservative across the verbs the tool hosts:

* `mcp.WithTitleAnnotation(string)` -- human-readable display name for UI tool pickers.
* `mcp.WithReadOnlyHintAnnotation(bool)` -- `false` if any verb writes (true only for tools whose every verb is read-only).
* `mcp.WithDestructiveHintAnnotation(bool)` -- `true` if any verb irreversibly deletes data or sends cancellation notices (verbs `calendar.delete_event`, `calendar.cancel_meeting`, `account.remove`).
* `mcp.WithIdempotentHintAnnotation(bool)` -- `false` if any verb is non-idempotent (creates new resources each call).
* `mcp.WithOpenWorldHintAnnotation(bool)` -- `true` if any verb calls Microsoft Graph; `false` only for tools whose every verb is local (no Graph verbs).

Per-verb annotation semantics **MUST** be documented in the `operation="help"` output for the domain. Annotation values **MUST** be explicitly set even when they match MCP spec defaults. The complete annotation matrix is defined in CR-0052; the conservative-aggregation rule is defined in CR-0060. New verbs **MUST** add a corresponding assertion in `internal/tools/tool_annotations_test.go`.

## MCP Tool Response Tiering

All MCP tool responses **MUST** follow a three-tier output model to minimize token consumption for LLM consumers while preserving data access for programmatic use cases:

| Tier | Mode | Default | Format | Use Case |
|------|------|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `text` | **Yes** | CLI-like plain text with numbered lists and labeled fields | General LLM consumption, human-readable display |
| 2 | `summary` | No | Compact JSON with an intentionally curated field set per tool | Programmatic LLM reasoning requiring structured data |
| 3 | `raw` | No | Full, unmodified JSON matching Graph API response shape | Debugging, full-field inspection |

### Rules

* **Read tools** accept an `output` parameter with values `text` (default), `summary`, and `raw`. All three tiers **MUST** be implemented.
* **Write tools** return text confirmations unconditionally (no `output` parameter). Confirmations include the action, subject, resource ID, key fields, and contextual message strings (e.g., attendee notification status).
* **`text` is the default** — tool handlers **MUST** return plain text when `output` is empty or omitted.
* **`raw` must be explicitly requested** — it is never the default for any tool. Raw output is the complete, unmodified Graph API serialization including empty values.
* **`summary` field sets are intentional** — each tool's summary mode uses a deliberately chosen field set via a dedicated serialization function (e.g., `SerializeSummaryEvent`). Summary fields are **not** derived by filtering empty values from raw output. New tools **MUST** define their summary field set explicitly.
* **Text formatters** live in `internal/tools/text_format.go`. New formatters follow the established patterns: numbered lists for collections, labeled fields for details, total counts at the end.
* **Body escalation pattern** (amended by CR-0068): Tools that return content previews by default (e.g., `bodyPreview`) **MUST** document in their tool description how to obtain the full content. The preview remains the default so the LLM can decide from it whether fetching the full content is worth the tokens. Five rules govern the escalation itself:
    * **The escalation target is a `body_mode` parameter, not an output tier.** Mail read verbs that can return a body accept `body_mode` with values `preview` (default), `text` (full body, converted to plain text by Graph) and `full` (full body as stored, usually HTML). `output` selects the *shape* of the response; `body_mode` selects *how much of the body* that shape carries. The two are orthogonal and every combination is valid. There are exactly three output tiers and a fourth **MUST NOT** be added for this purpose.
    * **Plain text comes from Graph, never from local parsing.** `body_mode=text` is implemented by sending `Prefer: outlook.body-content-type="text"`. This repository **MUST NOT** acquire an HTML parsing, stripping, or sanitizing dependency (see CR-0019 on HTML handling responsibility).
    * **`body_mode` is scoped to `mail.get_message` and `mail.get_conversation`.** Collection verbs (`list_messages`, `search_messages`) **MUST NOT** accept it: returning N full bodies from a browse is exactly what the tiering exists to prevent, and their results already carry the message IDs needed to escalate one message.
    * **A truncated preview must say so.** When a text formatter falls back to a preview, it **MUST** state in band that the preview was cut. A response that stops mid-sentence with no marker is indistinguishable from a short message.
    * **`Prefer` preferences are composed, never stacked.** All request preferences **MUST** be built through `tools.newPreferHeaders`, which joins them into a single header value. Calling `RequestHeaders.Add("Prefer", …)` twice makes the Kiota adapter emit two `Prefer` header lines in non-deterministic order.

### Why This Matters

Every token in an MCP tool response competes with user instructions, conversation history, and LLM reasoning space. A 10-event JSON list consumes ~2,500 tokens; the same data as text consumes ~800 tokens — a 68% reduction. Over a session with 20-30 tool calls, this saves thousands of tokens and materially improves LLM performance.

## MCP Tool Testing Instructions

When a new MCP tool is added or an existing tool's parameters/behavior change, `docs/prompts/mcp-tool-crud-test.md` **MUST** be updated to include testing steps that exercise the new or changed functionality. This keeps the CRUD lifecycle test accurate and ensures all tools are covered by the integration test script.

### Harness Maintenance

The `make crud-test` harness (`scripts/crud-test.sh`) **MUST** be lifecycled alongside MCP tool surface changes. When a verb, domain, or tool is added, renamed, or removed, the following **MUST** be updated in the same change:

* `docs/prompts/mcp-tool-crud-test.md` — the prompt the headless agent executes; new verbs need new test steps, removed verbs need their steps deleted.
* `scripts/crud-test.sh` — if a new top-level domain (currently `calendar`, `mail`, `account`, `system`) is introduced, add a corresponding `mcp_<domain>` column to the CSV header and a matching bucket in the per-run tool-count `awk` block. Removed domains require pruning the column and bucket.
* `docs/bench/crud-runs.csv` — header **MUST** match the script's output schema; reset historical rows when columns change rather than leaving short rows.

The harness's value depends on this coupling: drift means the bench either silently skips new functionality or emits malformed CSV rows.

## Documentation Governance

User-facing documentation has a single source of truth per concern. Future CRs that add or change documentation **MUST** route content according to the rules below.

1. **Per-tool reference** (verb name, parameters, return shape, examples) is owned by the `Verb` registry in `internal/tools/dispatch_registry.go`. Each verb populates `Summary`, `Description`, and where applicable `Examples` and `SeeDocs`. The `system.help` verb renders the registry; do not duplicate this content in markdown.
2. **Narrative concepts** (output tiers, multi-account model, gating modes, authentication flows, OAuth scopes summary, observability overview, well-known client IDs, in-server documentation surface, MCP elicitation) live in `docs/concepts.md`. New concepts are added as new anchored sections; verbs reference them via `SeeDocs`. Detailed contributor-level material (sequence diagrams, token cache schema, middleware chain, OTel attribute lists) does NOT belong here; it lives in `docs/reference/` and is not embedded.
3. **First-run workflow** lives in `docs/quickstart.md`. Configuration steps, integration setup, and end-to-end verification go here.
4. **Failure modes and recovery** live in `docs/troubleshooting.md`. Each entry has a stable anchor for `SeeDocs` references.
5. **Architecture and internals** live in `docs/reference/{architecture,auth-flows,observability,release}.md`. These files are not embedded into the binary. The boundary rule: if an LLM helping a user mid-session needs the content to use or troubleshoot the server, it belongs in an embedded file (`concepts.md` or `troubleshooting.md`); if only a contributor modifying the code needs it, it belongs in `docs/reference/`.
6. **Governance** (CRs and ADRs) lives in `docs/cr/` and `docs/adr/`. Not embedded.
7. The repository-root `README.md` is a landing page only. It contains install, the four-domain tool invocation example, a link grid into `docs/`, and the licence. It **MUST NOT** contain per-tool reference, full configuration tables, or narrative concepts.
8. The embedded bundle is exactly four files: `docs/{readme,quickstart,concepts,troubleshooting}.md`. Adding a fifth requires updating `docs/embed.go`, the allowlist test, and this section.
9. **Placement decision tree for new content:**
   - Is it 1:1 with a verb? → registry (`Description`, `Examples`).
   - Does it span verbs and explain a concept? → `docs/concepts.md`.
   - Is it a step-by-step setup workflow? → `docs/quickstart.md`.
   - Is it a failure mode and how to recover? → `docs/troubleshooting.md`.
   - Is it architecture, internals, or a build/release detail? → `docs/reference/`.
   - Is it a decision or scope change? → CR or ADR under `docs/cr/` or `docs/adr/`.

## Quality Standards

All code changes **MUST** meet the following quality requirements before committing. Use the `Makefile` targets to run checks:

| Check | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Build** | `make build` | Code must compile successfully |
| **Vet** | `make vet` | Static analysis must pass |
| **Format** | `make fmt-check` | All code must be formatted (`make fmt` to auto-fix) |
| **Tidy** | `make tidy` | `go.mod` and `go.sum` must be tidy |
| **Lint** | `make lint` | All `golangci-lint` checks must pass |
| **Test** | `make test` | All tests must pass (includes `-race` and coverage) |
| **SBOM** | `make sbom` | Generate Software Bill of Materials (CycloneDX + SPDX) |
| **Vuln Scan** | `make vuln-scan` | Vulnerability scan must pass with no high-severity findings |
| **License** | `make license-check` | Dependency license compliance check |

* Any accepted linter warnings **MUST** have an explanatory `//nolint` comment.
* Pre-commit hooks must pass (see `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).

Run all quality checks at once before pushing:
```bash
make ci
```

Do not commit code that breaks builds, fails linting, or causes test failures.

## Commit and PR Conventions

Agents **MUST** follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for:

* All commit messages
* GitHub pull request titles

### Conventional Commit Format

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types include:

* `feat`: A new feature
* `fix`: A bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation only changes
* `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
* `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example: `feat(automation): toggle light when front door is unlocked`

### Branch Protection

Force pushes are **BLOCKED** on protected branches. Always create new commits instead of rewriting history.

Direct commits to `main` (the default branch) are **PROHIBITED**. All changes **MUST** go through a pull request.

### Merge Strategy

Pull requests **MUST** use squash merge only. The PR title will become the commit message, so ensure it follows the Conventional Commits format.

### Linear Commit History

A **linear commit history is required**. Merge commits are not allowed. Use rebase or squash merge strategies to maintain a clean, linear history on the main branch.
