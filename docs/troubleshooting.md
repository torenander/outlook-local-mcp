# Troubleshooting Guide

Common failure modes and remediation steps for `outlook-local-mcp`.

---

## Authentication failures

**Symptom:** A tool call returns an error like `authentication required` or `failed to acquire token`.

**Cause:** No token has been cached for the account, or the cached token has expired.

**Remediation:**

1. Call `{tool: "account", args: {operation: "list"}}` to see which accounts are registered and which are disconnected.
2. If the account shows `disconnected`, call `{tool: "account", args: {operation: "login", label: "<label>"}}` to re-authenticate using the account's persisted method.
3. If no account is registered at all, call `{tool: "account", args: {operation: "add", label: "default"}}` to register and authenticate the first account.
4. After successful login, retry the original tool call. The `AuthMiddleware` will automatically retry once authentication completes.

---

## Token refresh

**Symptom:** A tool call returns an error referencing `token expired`, `refresh token`, or `invalid_grant`.

**Cause:** The OAuth refresh token expired (typically after 90 days of inactivity or after an Entra ID policy change) or the token cache was corrupted.

**Remediation:**

1. Call `{tool: "account", args: {operation: "refresh", label: "<label>"}}` to force a silent token refresh. This succeeds when the refresh token is still valid.
2. If the refresh fails, call `{tool: "account", args: {operation: "login", label: "<label>"}}` to initiate a new interactive authentication flow.
3. After re-authenticating, the server persists a new token and automatically retries the pending tool call.

**Prevention:** The server performs a silent token probe at startup for every authentication method, pre-caching tokens before the first tool call. Independently of that probe, the auth middleware retries a silent acquisition before every interactive flow it would otherwise start, so an expired access token backed by a live refresh credential is renewed without any prompt. Credentials are configured so that a cache miss reports an error rather than spontaneously opening a browser or emitting a device code mid-request.

---

## Device code flow

**Symptom:** Authentication returns a device code URL and code in the tool result text instead of completing automatically.

**Cause:** The MCP client does not support the Elicitation API (e.g., Claude Code). Where URL elicitation *is* supported the server presents a direct link to the sign-in page (`https://microsoft.com/devicelogin?otc=<code>`) with the code quoted alongside it; otherwise it falls back to returning the device code message from Entra ID verbatim in the tool result.

**Note on the link:** it takes you straight to the device sign-in page, but it does **not** fill the code in for you. Microsoft preserves the `otc` parameter through the redirect and still renders the Code field empty, so type the code shown in the message. An empty field is expected, not a bug.

**Remediation:**

1. Copy the URL and code from the tool result.
2. Open the URL in a browser, enter the code, and complete the Microsoft sign-in.
3. After sign-in, call any tool again. The server picks up the cached token automatically.

**Notes:**

- `device_code` is the default for the shipped client ID, and the only flow that completes against Microsoft's first-party app registrations. See [Why device code is the default](#why-device-code-is-the-default).
- The server tries a silent token refresh before every prompt, so a device code should appear only on a genuinely cold cache — not merely because an access token expired.
- The sign-in link is a navigation shortcut only. You always have to type the code.
- A device code flow that is never completed no longer freezes the session. The background attempt is bounded at 300 seconds, after which the pending state clears by itself.
- While a device code sign-in is outstanding, calendar and mail verbs report that authentication is in progress, but every `account` verb (`list`, `login`, `refresh`, ...) remains callable and returns promptly. `account.list` may show a blank email for accounts whose address has not been resolved yet, and `account.refresh` declines with an explanation — both because the credential is locked for the duration of the sign-in. Use `account.login` if you need to act.
- If your organisation blocks device code flow (`AADSTS50199`), you will need your own app registration with an `http://localhost` redirect URI, set via `OUTLOOK_MCP_CLIENT_ID`, which selects the `browser` flow.

---

## Why device code is the default {#why-device-code-is-the-default}

**Question:** Why does the server make me approve a code instead of just opening a browser?

**Answer:** Because the other two flows do not work against the Microsoft first-party client ID the server ships with (`d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c`). Both were tested end to end against a real account:

- **`browser`** fails. `InteractiveBrowserCredential` binds a random localhost port, and that app registration has no `http://localhost` redirect URI, so Entra ID rejects the sign-in:
  `AADSTS50011: The redirect URI 'http://localhost:65053' specified in the request does not match the redirect URIs configured for the application`.
- **`auth_code`** no longer completes. Microsoft now shows an anti-phishing interstitial on the redirect page — *"This page is not normally shown and could be a sign of a phishing attempt. The URL contains your password. Close this page immediately and do not copy or share the URL with anyone"* — and then *"You have reached the wrong page"*. Copying a code out of the address bar is exactly the pattern Microsoft is hardening against.

Device code is what remains. To avoid it entirely, register your own application in Entra ID with an `http://localhost` redirect URI and set `OUTLOOK_MCP_CLIENT_ID` to its UUID; custom client IDs default to the `browser` flow.

---

## Browser auth flow

**Symptom:** A tool call returns an error like `browser authentication timed out` or the browser window did not appear.

**Cause:** The server opened the system browser for OAuth login but the user did not complete sign-in within the timeout, or the browser did not open (headless environment).

**Remediation:**

1. Retry the tool call to trigger a fresh browser auth attempt.
2. If the sign-in fails with `AADSTS50011`, the app registration in use has no `http://localhost` redirect URI. The Microsoft first-party client IDs do not; register your own application and set `OUTLOOK_MCP_CLIENT_ID`, or fall back to `device_code`.
3. For machines with no browser at all, use `device_code` authentication: set `OUTLOOK_MCP_AUTH_METHOD=device_code`. It is already the default for well-known client IDs.

---

## Auth code flow

**Symptom:** The server returns an auth URL and asks you to paste the redirect URL back.

**Cause:** The `auth_code` method was selected explicitly via `OUTLOOK_MCP_AUTH_METHOD=auth_code`. After signing in, the browser redirects to the `nativeclient` URI and shows the full redirect URL in the address bar.

**Before you use this flow:** against Microsoft's first-party client IDs it no longer completes. The redirect page now shows an anti-phishing warning telling you not to copy the URL, followed by "You have reached the wrong page". It is not the default for that reason. It may still work against your own app registration.

**Remediation:**

1. Copy the full redirect URL from the browser address bar after sign-in. It starts with `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`.
2. If the MCP client supports Elicitation, paste it into the prompt.
3. If not, call `{tool: "system", args: {operation: "complete_auth", redirect_url: "<url>"}}` to exchange the code for a token. Add `account: "<label>"` when the sign-in was for a named account.

**Notes:**

- `system.complete_auth` is registered unconditionally, so it does not vanish when you switch methods. Calling it while the target account uses `browser` or `device_code` is not an error; the verb replies with the recovery path that does apply.
- Authorization codes expire after roughly 10 minutes. If the exchange fails with an expired-code error, start the sign-in again with `{tool: "account", args: {operation: "login", label: "<label>"}}`.

---

## Keychain locked

**Symptom:** Token storage fails with an error referencing `keychain`, `SecKeychain`, `libsecret`, or `DPAPI`.

**Cause:** The OS keychain is locked, unavailable, or the process lacks permission to access it (common in headless, container, or screen-locked environments).

**Remediation:**

1. Unlock the keychain (macOS: open **Keychain Access** and unlock the login keychain; Linux: ensure `gnome-keyring` or `kwallet` is running).
2. If the keychain cannot be unlocked, set `OUTLOOK_MCP_TOKEN_STORAGE=file` in the server configuration to switch to the file-based AES-256-GCM encrypted token cache at `~/.outlook-local-mcp/token_cache.bin`.
3. Restart the server after changing `OUTLOOK_MCP_TOKEN_STORAGE`.
4. Container and Docker builds (`CGO_ENABLED=0`) always use the file-based cache regardless of `TOKEN_STORAGE` setting; no action required.

**Note:** When `TOKEN_STORAGE=auto` (the default) and the keychain is unavailable, the server automatically falls back to the file cache. Only `TOKEN_STORAGE=keychain` (no fallback) will error in this scenario.

---

## Multi-account resolution

**Symptom:** A tool call errors with `multiple authenticated accounts` or the wrong account is used.

**Cause:** Multiple accounts are authenticated and no `account` parameter was supplied.

**Remediation:**

1. Call `{tool: "account", args: {operation: "list"}}` to see all registered accounts with their labels and UPNs.
2. Pass the `account` parameter to any tool: `{tool: "calendar", args: {operation: "list_events", account: "work"}}`. Both label and UPN (e.g., `alice@contoso.com`) are accepted.
3. If the MCP client supports Elicitation, a prompt appears for account selection when no `account` param is supplied; select the desired account from the list.

**Account states:**

- `authenticated`: Token is cached and valid.
- `disconnected`: Account is registered but the token expired or was cleared. Call `account.login` to reconnect.

---

## Graph 429 throttling

**Symptom:** A tool call returns an error like `Graph API error [TooManyRequests]: 429` or `ApplicationThrottled`.

**Cause:** The Microsoft Graph API is rate-limiting requests from this application or tenant.

**Remediation:**

1. Wait a few seconds and retry the tool call. The server applies automatic exponential backoff for 429 responses (configured via `OUTLOOK_MCP_MAX_RETRIES` and `OUTLOOK_MCP_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`).
2. If throttling persists, increase `OUTLOOK_MCP_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS` (default 1000ms) to give Graph more recovery time between retries.
3. Avoid tight loops of rapid tool calls, especially for calendar listing operations across large date ranges.

**Configuration:** `OUTLOOK_MCP_MAX_RETRIES` (default 3) and `OUTLOOK_MCP_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS` (default 1000) control the retry behaviour. Check the current values with `{tool: "system", args: {operation: "status", output: "summary"}}` under `config.graph_api`.

---

## Inefficient filter

**Symptom:** A tool call returns an error like `Graph API error [ErrorInvalidRequest]` or a message referencing `InefficientFilter` or missing `$orderby` constraints.

**Cause:** The Microsoft Graph `$filter` query contains a condition on a non-indexed field without the required `$orderby` clause, or uses a filter expression that Graph does not support server-side.

**Remediation:**

1. Avoid filtering on non-indexed properties. Graph indexes `subject`, `start/dateTime`, `end/dateTime`, `organizer/emailAddress/address`, and `isOrganizer` for calendar queries.
2. When using `$filter` on `start/dateTime` or `end/dateTime`, include `$orderby=start/dateTime` (or `end/dateTime`) in the same request.
3. For mail queries, use the `search` parameter (KQL syntax) instead of `$filter` for full-text search. `$filter` on mail supports `isRead`, `isDraft`, `hasAttachments`, `importance`, `flag/flagStatus`, and `receivedDateTime`.
4. If the error persists, use `output=raw` on the offending tool to see the full OData error detail, then adjust the filter expression.

---

## Mail disabled

**Symptom:** The `mail` tool returns `mail access is not enabled` or `unknown operation`.

**Cause:** The `OUTLOOK_MCP_MAIL_ENABLED` environment variable is not set (default is `false`). Mail tools are only registered when mail access is explicitly enabled.

**Remediation:**

1. Set `OUTLOOK_MCP_MAIL_ENABLED=true` in the server's environment configuration and restart the server.
2. Verify the setting with `{tool: "system", args: {operation: "status", output: "summary"}}` and check `config.features.mail_enabled`.
3. On first enable, a new OAuth consent for `Mail.Read` is required. The authentication flow triggers automatically on the next tool call.

---

## Mail management disabled

**Symptom:** Draft operations (`create_draft`, `create_reply_draft`, `create_forward_draft`, `update_draft`, `delete_draft`) return `mail management is not enabled` or `unknown operation`.

**Cause:** `OUTLOOK_MCP_MAIL_MANAGE_ENABLED` is not set. Draft management is a separate opt-in that implies `MAIL_ENABLED`.

**Remediation:**

1. Set `OUTLOOK_MCP_MAIL_MANAGE_ENABLED=true` (this automatically enables `MAIL_ENABLED` as well) and restart the server.
2. Verify with `{tool: "system", args: {operation: "status", output: "summary"}}` and check `config.features.mail_manage_enabled`.
3. On first enable, a new OAuth consent for `Mail.ReadWrite` is required (supersedes `Mail.Read`). The authentication flow triggers automatically on the next tool call.

**Note:** The server never requests `Mail.Send`. Drafts are created in the Outlook Drafts folder; the user sends them manually from Outlook.

---

## Read-only mode

**Symptom:** Write tool calls (create, update, delete, cancel, draft operations) return `server is in read-only mode`.

**Cause:** `OUTLOOK_MCP_READ_ONLY=true` is set. In read-only mode all write operations are blocked at the `ReadOnlyGuard` middleware before reaching the handler.

**Remediation:**

1. If read-only mode is intentional (e.g., a shared or supervised environment), do not change this setting. Only read verbs (`list_*`, `get_*`, `search_*`, `status`) are available.
2. To re-enable writes, remove or set `OUTLOOK_MCP_READ_ONLY=false` and restart the server.
3. Verify the current mode with `{tool: "system", args: {operation: "status"}}` and look for `read-only=on` in the Features line.

---

## Log file location

Logs are written to the path configured in `OUTLOOK_MCP_LOG_FILE`. By default, no file logging is active and logs are written only to stderr (which the MCP client typically captures but does not surface in the chat).

To enable file logging:

1. Set `OUTLOOK_MCP_LOG_FILE=/path/to/outlook-local-mcp.log` in the server environment.
2. Set `OUTLOOK_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for verbose output during troubleshooting.
3. Restart the server.

The log file path and current level can be read with `{tool: "system", args: {operation: "status", output: "summary"}}` under `config.logging.log_file` and `config.logging.log_level`.

**PII sanitization:** When `OUTLOOK_MCP_LOG_SANITIZE=true` (the default), email addresses and other identifiers are replaced with redacted placeholders in all log output. Set to `false` only in controlled debugging sessions.

**Audit log:** When `OUTLOOK_MCP_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true`, a structured audit trail is written to `OUTLOOK_MCP_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` (defaults to a file alongside the main log). The audit log records every tool invocation with timestamp, operation name, account label, and outcome.

---

## Account lifecycle

The `account` domain tool manages the full lifecycle of Microsoft accounts registered with the server.

### Add an account

```
{tool: "account", args: {operation: "add", label: "work"}}
```

Registers and authenticates a new account. Optional parameters: `client_id`, `tenant_id`, `auth_method`. The UPN (`alice@contoso.com`) is resolved from Graph `/me` and persisted to `accounts.json` after successful authentication.

### List accounts

```
{tool: "account", args: {operation: "list"}}
```

Returns all registered accounts with label, UPN, authentication state, and auth method. Disconnected accounts (expired tokens) are shown as first-class entries, not hidden.

### Log in a disconnected account

```
{tool: "account", args: {operation: "login", label: "work"}}
```

Re-authenticates a disconnected account using its persisted `auth_method`, `client_id`, and `tenant_id`. Errors if the account is already connected.

### Log out an account

```
{tool: "account", args: {operation: "logout", label: "work"}}
```

Disconnects an account without removing its configuration from `accounts.json`. The account remains visible as `disconnected` and can be reconnected via `account.login`.

### Force token refresh

```
{tool: "account", args: {operation: "refresh", label: "work"}}
```

Forces a silent token refresh (`ForceRefresh=true`). Returns the new token expiry. Useful after an Entra ID permission change or when token staleness is suspected.

### Remove an account

```
{tool: "account", args: {operation: "remove", label: "work"}}
```

Permanently removes the account from the registry, clears its keychain cache, and rewrites `accounts.json` (atomic temp-file + rename) without the removed entry so the removal survives a restart (see CR-0064). When `accounts.json` has no entry for the label (for example the implicit `default` created from env config), the in-memory removal still succeeds for the current session but the entry reappears at the next start. Use `account.logout` instead when you want to disconnect without deleting the configuration. See [Auto-default account](#auto-default-account) for the implicit-default gating rule.

---

## Auto-default account {#auto-default-account}

The implicit `default` account registration is conditional on `accounts.json` contents, and `account.remove` is persistent across restart (see CR-0064).

### Ghost-default scenario

On startup, the server registers an implicit "default" account from the env config (`OUTLOOK_MCP_CLIENT_ID`, `OUTLOOK_MCP_TENANT_ID`, `OUTLOOK_MCP_AUTH_METHOD`) when no entry in `accounts.json` already covers that identity. If the keychain or file token cache has been cleared for that identity, `account_list` shows a disconnected `default` entry. The first tool call that falls through to "default" will trigger an authentication prompt (device-code or browser), which may be unexpected in a multi-account setup.

**Remedy:** Add an entry to `accounts.json` whose `client_id` and `tenant_id` match the env config, or use `account_remove default` to remove the ghost entry for the current session.

### Persistent-removal semantics

`account_remove` is durable across restarts when `accounts.json` contains an entry for the removed label. After removal, the server rewrites `accounts.json` without that entry. The removed account does not return on the next start.

When `accounts.json` has no entry for the label (for example, the implicit "default" created from env config without any `accounts.json`), the in-memory removal still succeeds for the current session, but the entry reappears at the next start because `main.go` re-registers it from the env config.

### accounts.json gating rule

The implicit "default" is skipped at startup when either of these is true:

- `accounts.json` contains an entry whose `client_id` and `tenant_id` match the env config, regardless of that entry's label.
- `accounts.json` contains any entry with the literal label `"default"`.

When neither is true (for example, `accounts.json` is absent or empty), the implicit "default" is registered so that single-account env-only setups continue to work without authoring a config file.

### Removing a cfg-identity-covering entry causes default to reappear

If `accounts.json` has a single entry whose `client_id` and `tenant_id` match the env config, removing that entry causes the implicit "default" to reappear at the next start. This is intentional: removing the entry from `accounts.json` removes the gating signal, so `main.go` falls back to the implicit default. To suppress the implicit default permanently, keep an `accounts.json` entry that covers the cfg identity under any label.

## In-server documentation access

The server embeds this guide and other user-facing documentation. The LLM can access it directly without leaving the session:

```
{tool: "system", args: {operation: "list_docs"}}
{tool: "system", args: {operation: "search_docs", query: "token refresh"}}
{tool: "system", args: {operation: "get_docs", slug: "troubleshooting", section: "token-refresh"}}
```

Each embedded document is also available as an MCP resource at `doc://outlook-local-mcp/{slug}` (e.g., `doc://outlook-local-mcp/troubleshooting`). LLM clients that support `resources/list` and `resources/read` can fetch documents natively.
