# Concepts

Core concepts for outlook-local-mcp. Use these as background when the Quick Start or Troubleshooting guide is not enough.

## Output tiers

All read tools accept an `output` parameter with three modes. Write tools return concise text confirmations unconditionally.

**`text`** (default) returns pre-formatted plain text optimised for LLM context consumption. Collections render as numbered lists with human-readable fields and a total count. A 12,000-token raw Graph API event becomes roughly 150-800 tokens in text mode — a 60-70% reduction. The LLM can pass this through without additional formatting.

**`summary`** returns compact JSON with a deliberately curated field set per tool. Useful when the LLM needs structured data for programmatic reasoning. Nested objects are flattened: start/end become plain dateTime strings, organizer becomes a name string. Summary mode includes a `displayTime` field with a pre-formatted human-readable time string.

**`raw`** returns the full, unmodified Graph API serialisation including empty values. Use this when you need HTML body content, recurrence patterns, attendee email addresses, or other detailed fields. `raw` is never the default; it must be requested explicitly.

Invalid values return an error: `output must be 'summary', 'raw', or 'text'`.

## Multi-account model and UPN identity

The server supports managing multiple Microsoft accounts simultaneously. Each account is identified by a human-chosen **label** (e.g., `work`, `personal`). The User Principal Name (UPN, e.g. `alice@contoso.com`) resolved from Microsoft Graph `/me` is the **canonical identity** and is persisted to `accounts.json` in the `upn` field.

UPN is available immediately at startup without a Graph API call and is shown in all account surfaces (`account.list`, `system.status`, elicitation prompts, write-tool confirmations). Any tool that accepts an `account` parameter resolves it by label first, then by case-insensitive UPN fallback — so `account=alice@contoso.com` and `account=work` both target the same entry.

Account selection logic for calendar and mail verbs:

- **Explicit selection** — pass `account: "label"` or `account: "upn"`.
- **Single authenticated account, no others** — auto-selected silently.
- **Single authenticated account with disconnected siblings** — auto-selected, with an advisory naming the disconnected accounts by UPN so the LLM can surface them.
- **Multiple authenticated accounts** — the server uses MCP Elicitation to prompt for selection.
- **All accounts disconnected** — error lists disconnected accounts by UPN and suggests `account.login`.
- **No accounts registered** — error directs to `account.add`.
- **Elicitation unsupported or fails** — the default account is used as a fallback; if no default exists, the error lists available accounts and suggests using the `account` parameter.

Each account has its own token cache partition, auth record file, and Graph client instance. The `accounts.json` file stores only non-secret identity metadata. Tokens and credentials are managed separately by the OS-native token cache. The file is written atomically to prevent corruption on sudden exit.

## Auto-default account semantics

A **default account** is registered automatically at startup using the server's configured credentials (`CLIENT_ID`, `TENANT_ID`, `AUTH_METHOD`). Additional accounts added via `account.add` are persisted to `accounts.json` and restored on subsequent startups with silent token acquisition from the per-account cache (see CR-0064).

At startup the server performs a silent token probe (5-second timeout) to pre-authenticate persisted accounts. Accounts with expired tokens are registered as **disconnected** — they remain visible in `account.list` and `system.status` and can be reconnected explicitly via `account.login`, or will be re-authenticated automatically by the auth middleware on the first tool call that targets them.

The default account cannot be removed via `account.remove`.

## MCP elicitation requirement

Multi-account features (account selection prompts, inline authentication during `account.add`) use the MCP Elicitation API. The server declares the `elicitation` capability at startup. MCP clients that support elicitation receive interactive prompts; clients that do not fall back to the default account for account selection and receive authentication feedback as tool result text.

Two elicitation modes are used:

- **Form mode** collects a value from the user. The `auth_code` flow uses it to ask for the redirect URL from the browser's address bar.
- **URL mode** asks the user to open a link. The `browser` flow uses it to announce the login page, and the `device_code` flow uses it to send the user straight to the device sign-in page (`https://microsoft.com/devicelogin?otc=<code>`) with the code quoted in the accompanying message. The link saves finding the page; it does not fill the code in for you — Microsoft renders the code field empty — so you still type it.

Elicitation is never required. Every flow has a plain-text fallback that is returned verbatim in the tool result, because some clients answer elicitation requests with "Method not found" and the tool result is then the only channel that reaches the user:

- `auth_code` — the server returns the authorization URL and the caller finishes with `system.complete_auth`. That verb is always registered, whichever method is active, so it can never be missing at the moment it is needed.
- `device_code` — the server returns the device code message from Entra ID unchanged.
- `browser` — the server sends a log notification and opens the system browser directly.

For `device_code` auth without elicitation, `account.add` uses a two-call pattern: the first call returns the device code and keeps the authentication goroutine alive in the background; the second call with the same label picks up the completed authentication and registers the account.

## Read-only mode

Set `OUTLOOK_MCP_READ_ONLY=true` to disable all write operations. All write verbs (`calendar.create_event`, `calendar.create_meeting`, `calendar.update_event`, `calendar.update_meeting`, `calendar.delete_event`, `calendar.cancel_meeting`, `calendar.respond_event`, `calendar.reschedule_event`, `calendar.reschedule_meeting`, `mail.create_draft`, `mail.create_reply_draft`, `mail.create_forward_draft`, `mail.update_draft`, `mail.delete_draft`) return an error when invoked. Read and search verbs remain fully functional.

```bash
OUTLOOK_MCP_READ_ONLY=true ./outlook-local-mcp
```

## Mail gating

Mail access is disabled by default and enabled in two tiers via environment variables:

| Variable | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MAIL_ENABLED` | `false` (default) | Mail verbs unavailable; no mail OAuth scope requested |
| `MAIL_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables read-only mail verbs (`mail.list_folders`, `mail.list_messages`, `mail.search_messages`, `mail.get_message`, `mail.get_attachment`); requests `Mail.Read` scope |
| `MAIL_MANAGE_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables all mail verbs including draft management (implies `MAIL_ENABLED`); requests `Mail.ReadWrite` scope |

`Mail.Send` is **never** requested under any configuration. The model prepares drafts that land in Outlook Drafts for manual review; email is never sent automatically. Enabling mail read for the first time triggers an incremental consent prompt; upgrading to mail manage triggers re-consent.

## Headless and non-interactive authentication

Authentication is lazy — deferred until the first tool call rather than blocking at startup. Three flows are available, controlled by `OUTLOOK_MCP_AUTH_METHOD`. An explicit value always wins; when the variable is unset the method is inferred from the client ID.

**`device_code`** (default for well-known client IDs, including the shipped `outlook-desktop` default) — the server obtains a device code from Entra ID and delivers it to the user: as a direct link to the sign-in page plus the code where the client supports URL elicitation, and as plain tool result text otherwise. The tool returns immediately; the next tool call after the user approves the sign-in picks up the cached token. Works everywhere, including headless and Docker.

It is the default because it is the only flow that completes against the Microsoft first-party client IDs. The alternatives were both tested live and both fail: `browser` is rejected with `AADSTS50011` because those app registrations have no `http://localhost` redirect URI, and `auth_code` is now blocked by a Microsoft anti-phishing interstitial on the redirect page that warns the user not to copy the URL and then refuses to complete. Its one real cost is that a person must approve the code out of band, which is why the server avoids reaching that point wherever it can.

**`browser`** (default for custom app registrations) — the system browser opens to the Microsoft login page and the server listens on a localhost port for the OAuth callback. Requires an app registration with an `http://localhost` redirect URI. Register your own application and set `OUTLOOK_MCP_CLIENT_ID` to use it.

**`auth_code`** — the system browser opens for OAuth login; after signing in the user hands the redirect URL back through MCP Elicitation or the `system.complete_auth` verb, and the server exchanges it for tokens using PKCE. Fully supported and selectable with `OUTLOOK_MCP_AUTH_METHOD=auth_code`, but no longer inferred: against the first-party client IDs Microsoft now interrupts the redirect page with an anti-phishing warning and the exchange does not complete. It may still work against your own app registration.

Before any of these flows starts, the server first tries to acquire a token silently from the cache. Interactive authentication only happens when that fails, so an expired access token with a live refresh token is renewed without the user noticing.

On subsequent runs the server acquires tokens silently using the cached refresh credential. Credentials are configured so that a cache miss reports an error rather than spontaneously opening a browser or emitting a device code in the middle of an unrelated request; the server decides when to prompt, not the identity library. No browser interaction is needed unless it expires (typically after 90 days of inactivity) or the token cache is cleared. When a token expires mid-session, the auth middleware detects the failure and re-initiates the flow that the affected account was registered with — which may differ from the server default in a multi-account setup.

While an authentication flow is outstanding, ordinary calendar and mail verbs report that authentication is in progress. The `account` verbs (`list`, `login`, `logout`, `refresh`, `add`, `remove`) stay available throughout, so the session can always be inspected and repaired.

## OAuth scopes used per feature

The server requests scopes incrementally. Expanding mail access after initial consent triggers a re-consent prompt.

| Feature | OAuth scope |
|---|---|
| Calendar (always active) | `Calendars.ReadWrite` |
| `MAIL_ENABLED=false` (default) | *(none)* |
| `MAIL_ENABLED=true` | `Mail.Read` |
| `MAIL_MANAGE_ENABLED=true` (implies `MAIL_ENABLED`) | `Mail.ReadWrite` |
| Refresh tokens (always) | `offline_access` (added automatically by the identity library) |

`Mail.Send` is never requested under any configuration.

## Well-known client IDs

`OUTLOOK_MCP_CLIENT_ID` accepts friendly names in addition to raw UUIDs. Resolution is case-insensitive.

| Friendly name | Client ID | Application |
|---|---|---|
| `outlook-desktop` (default) | `d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c` | Outlook desktop |
| `outlook-local-mcp` | `dd5fc5c5-eb9a-4f6f-97bd-1a9fecb277d3` | Outlook Local MCP (project app registration) |
| `teams-desktop` | `1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264` | Teams desktop and mobile |
| `teams-web` | `5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346` | Teams web |
| `m365-web` | `4765445b-32c6-49b0-83e6-1d93765276ca` | Microsoft 365 web |
| `m365-desktop` | `0ec893e0-5785-4de6-99da-4ed124e5296c` | Microsoft 365 desktop |
| `m365-mobile` | `d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c` | Microsoft 365 mobile |
| `outlook-web` | `bc59ab01-8403-45c6-8796-ac3ef710b3e3` | Outlook web |
| `outlook-mobile` | `27922004-5251-4030-b22d-91ecd9a37ea4` | Outlook mobile |

The default `outlook-desktop` client ID is pre-authorised for Graph Calendar scopes in all tenants — no admin consent required. If the value is not a recognised friendly name and does not look like a UUID, a warning is logged and the value is used as-is.

## In-server documentation surface

The server embeds its own documentation and exposes it through three verbs on the `system` domain:

```
{tool: "system", args: {operation: "list_docs"}}
{tool: "system", args: {operation: "search_docs", query: "token refresh"}}
{tool: "system", args: {operation: "get_docs", slug: "troubleshooting", section: "keychain-locked"}}
```

Each document is also exposed as an MCP resource at `doc://outlook-local-mcp/{slug}` for clients that support `resources/list` and `resources/read`. The server status response (`system.status`) includes a `docs` section with the base URI and the troubleshooting slug so an LLM client can locate the documentation surface without prior knowledge.

The embedded bundle contains exactly four slugs: `readme`, `quickstart`, `concepts` (this file), and `troubleshooting`.

## Observability at a glance

**Structured logging** — written to stderr. Configure with:

- `OUTLOOK_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` — minimum severity: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` (default `warn`)
- `OUTLOOK_MCP_LOG_FORMAT` — `json` (default) or `text`
- `OUTLOOK_MCP_LOG_SANITIZE` — when `true` (default), PII such as email addresses and event body content is masked
- `OUTLOOK_MCP_LOG_FILE` — when set, log records are written to both stderr and the specified file (append mode, `0600` permissions)

**Audit logging** — when `OUTLOOK_MCP_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true` (default), every tool invocation emits a structured JSON audit entry with the tool name, operation, and outcome. Set `OUTLOOK_MCP_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` to write entries to a file instead of stderr.

**OpenTelemetry** — optional OTLP gRPC export for metrics and traces:

```bash
OUTLOOK_MCP_OTEL_ENABLED=true \
OUTLOOK_MCP_OTEL_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317 \
./outlook-local-mcp
```

Metrics include per-tool invocation counts and durations. Traces create a span per tool invocation with tool name, parameters, and outcome attributes. Deep-dive OTel attribute lists and the full middleware chain are documented in `docs/reference/observability.md`.
